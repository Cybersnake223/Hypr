; When I first saw the above theme upon syntaxenvy.com generated it randomly,
; I've had a quick, bold association with the Johnny Mnemonic movie. I don't
; know why, but I've decided to name the theme like this and who knows, maybe
; someone will decipher the connection one day. The theme looks suprisingly
; well IMO and maybe it's the effect of having this movie property/connection.
;
; This theme is a descent of the 40 work hours (or more) non-public theme X-Paragon,
; which was created to say `thanks' to the patrons at Patreon.com/psprint. It should
; carry the same quality.

; The palette - naive and CIE L*a*b conversion:
