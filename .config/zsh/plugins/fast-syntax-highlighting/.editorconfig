# Space or Tabs?

#
# 1. What happens when I press the Tab key in my text editor?
# 2. What happens when I request my editor to indent one or more lines?
# 3. What happens when I view a file containing U+0009 HORIZONTAL TAB characters?
#
# Answers:
#
# 1. Pressing the Tab key should indent the current line (or selected lines) one additional level.
# 2. As a secondary alternative, I can also tolerate an editor that,
#    like Emacs, uses this key for a context-sensitive fix-my-indentation command.
# 3. Indenting one or more lines should follow the reigning convention, if consensus is sufficiently strong; otherwise,
#    I greatly prefer 2-space indentation at each level. U+0009 characters should shift subsequent characters to the next tab stop.
#
# Note: VIM users should use alternate marks [[[ and ]]] as the original ones can confuse nested substitutions, e.g.: ${${${VAR}}}
